# WCF service with Service Bus Relay
WCF Service for getting image via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-relay/relay-what-is-it">Azure Relay</a>.
The reason is to "publish" .Net REST WCF service via Azure Relay. 
There no direct publishing of this service. Service is using WCF Relay binding to publish it. You need no firewall port publishing, communication is started from backend via HTTPS.
Client is calling Azure Relay service.

## Create Service Bus Relay
Simply create in Azure portal new service called Relay
